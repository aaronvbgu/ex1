[Check the recipe on Carnation](https://www.carnation.co.uk/Recipes/8/Classic-Banoffee-Pie).

Ingredients
-----------
  1. 100g butter, melted
  2. 250g digestive biscuits, crushed
  3. 100g butter
  4. 100g dark brown soft sugar
  5. 397g can Carnation Condensed Milk
  6. 4 small bananas
  7. 300ml carton whipping cream, lightly whipped grated chocolate

Steps
-----
  * Tip the biscuit crumbs into a bowl. Add the butter and mix in. Spoon the crumbs into the base and about halfway up the sides     of the tin to make a pie shell. Chill for 10 minutes.
  * Melt the butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add     the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the     caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.
  * Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly           whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with the grated chocolate.
